### Project Description

This project features a 3D-designed robotic arm with **5 degrees of freedom (DOF)** created using advanced 3D design software.

The project aims to develop a **3D printable model** for practical applications in educational and industrial robotics sectors.

**Design Optimization:**
- **Accessibility** - Easy to understand and build
- **Cost-effectiveness** - Affordable components and materials
- **Real-world implementation** - Practical applications

This makes it suitable for students, researchers, and robotics enthusiasts.
