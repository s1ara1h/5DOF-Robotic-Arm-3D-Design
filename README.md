Project Description
This project features a 3D-designed robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) created using advanced 3D design software. The project aims to develop a 3D printable model for practical applications in educational and industrial robotics sectors.
The design is optimized for accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and real-world implementation, making it suitable for students, researchers, and robotics enthusiasts.
Five Degrees of Freedom

🔄 Base Rotation - Full 360° rotation around the vertical axis (Z-axis)
⬆️ Shoulder Joint - Vertical lifting and lowering motion of the primary arm
💪 Elbow Joint - Bending and extending motion of the secondary arm segment
🤲 Wrist Joint - Vertical pitch motion for precise positioning
✋ Gripper Mechanism - Open and close functionality for object manipulation
